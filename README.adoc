= Random Path Generator

This is a personal project that was initially started to automate the creation of permutations for my cell group for prayer purposes. I then decided to repurpose it into a generic path generator and also experiment with different ways to connect nodes in a graph to look more like a smooth curve.
A visual representation of the generated path can be shown by providing an image along with an input file that will dictate the possible paths that can be drawn on the image.

Currently, the generator has 2 methods to draw the paths between each member.

 . A *greedy* node selector that uses Euclidean distance heuristic that *does not* always return an optimal path. It does not use the *same* node twice for drawing so that no lines overlap completely with each other.
 . *Dijkstra's algorithm* from each member to the next. It currently allows usage of the same node twice, which might result in overlapping lines.

=== Inputs:
* Text file with list of members
** Intermediate nodes and all nodes' pixel locations followed by the adjacency list of each node (only required if visualization is desired)
* Image with members represented (only required if visualization is desired)
* Total number of members (only required if visualization is desired)

Sample input files are included.

_Nodes in the graph comprise of each member *AND* intermediate nodes that will form the paths between each member_

=== Syntax of text file input *with* input image:
[source,python]
----
# Each node's pixel location
# Start with members, then intermediate nodes
[MemberName]:[PixelX],[PixelY]
[MemberName2]:[PixelX],[PixelY]
[NodeNumber]:[PixelX],[PixelY]
[NodeNumber2]:[PixelX],[PixelY]

# Leave one line empty, then the adjacency list
[NodeNumber]:[ConnectedNodeNumber],[ConnectedNodeNumber2]
[NodeNumber2]:[ConnectedNodeNumber],[ConnectedNodeNumber2]
----

_Lines starting with "#" are treated as comments and are ignored._

=== Syntax of text file input *without* input image:
[source,python]
----
# List of members separated by commas
[MemberName],[MemberName2],[MemberName3],[MemberName4]
----

_Only the first uncommented line is read, following lines are ignored._

_Lines starting with "#" are treated as comments and are ignored._

=== Sample Result
ifdef::env-github[]
image:images/sample_result.png[width="400"]
endif::[]

=== Features
* Visual representation of the generated path 
_(sample input for 11 members is provided)_
* Path can be saved to prevent any repetition of *pairs* in future path generation
** Etc. If A -> B -> C was saved previously, A -> B and B -> C will not repeat
* Arrows on the image gradually changes color so that it is easy to follow the path

=== Required packages:
* Numpy
* OpenCV
